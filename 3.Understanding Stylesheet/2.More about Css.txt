Inheritance of STyle

If you give a certain style to an html element, all the children of that element will inherit that same style alse you overwrite them.

for example:
<p>I love <strong>Coding</strong>websites</p>
if you give the color blue to p tag then strong tag will take that color through inheritance because it is a child of p.

However if you define a color for strong tag then you have overwritten the inherited style blue color.
